This continued until the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling went into effect in 1986. Sea Shepherd Conservation Society contends that Japan, as well as Iceland and Norway, is in violation of the IWC moratorium on all commercial whaling. Japanese whaling is currently conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research, using the scientific research provision in the IWC agreement. The whale meat from these scientific whale hunts is sold in shops and restaurants. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the Japanese whaling program in the Southern Ocean, begun in 2005 and called ""JARPA II"", was not for scientific purposes and ordered the cessation of JARPA II in March 2014. Japanese whaling hunts are a source of conflict between pro- and anti-whaling countries and organizations. Nations, scientists and environmental organizations opposed to whaling consider the Japanese research program to be unnecessary, and that it is a thinly disguised commercial whaling operation. Greenpeace argues that whales are endangered and must be protected. Japanese whaling activities have historically extended far outside Japanese territorial waters.
